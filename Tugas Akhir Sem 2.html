        <img src="tfl.png"  style="width:470px;height:264px" border="5" align="middle"></br>
        <p>   Valorant is based around our real world, and The First Light happened around 2039. This event created an element that may be familiar to you: Radianite. 
            Some people who were exposed to Radianite obtained superpowers, and that's why our agents have abilities. All agents weren't bestowed with the same amount of power. 
            You may notice this in Killjoy, whose abilities don't affect her at all! Radianite was too powerful for the world to handle, so some people went rogue with power, while 
            others were humble. Because of this, 2 powerful organizations were created to make the maximum use of Radianite and the superpowered people called Kingdom and the VALORANT 
            Protocol.</p></br>
        <h3 style="text-align:center">VALORANT Protocol and Kingdom: Valorant's Story Saviors</h3></br>
        <p>   The Kingdom corporation is a power company that was created shortly after The First Light event. As time went on, Kingdom found out ways to use Radianite to their 
            advantage to supply civilization with power! Along with that, they also used Radianite to create weapons, gadgets, and all sorts of tech-related stuff. Being afraid of 
            rogue superpowered agents, they created a secret sub-organization called the VALORANT Protocol, with Brimstone and Viper as its leaders. Lots of people held grudge against 
            Kingdom, the VALORANT Protocol sought them out. They helped keep rogue agents at bay like Phoenix, but sometimes they recruited them to the protocol, advancing to 19+ 
            agents! These agents' purpose is to keep peace in the world, but nobody expected what would happen next.</p></br>
        <h3 style="text-align:center">Valorant DUELISTS Animation: Venice Spawns Ascent</h3></br>
        <p>   In 2049, after 10 years from The First Light, Jett appeared in Venice planting some kind of bomb which we all know it's the spike. Phoenix was sent in to resolve the issue 
            and in the first cinematic DUELISTS, we got to see the fight! Having a bad ending, the spike blew off and the Venice incident happened, which made a big chunk of the city 
            rise in the air. This chunk of land may be familiar to you because that is the Ascent map! After this incident, everyone was aware of what Radianite was capable of, 
            Kingdom's stocks plummeted to the ground, and everyone was in search of Jett. What they weren't aware of though was that the Venice incident wasn't the Jett's fault they 
            were thinking of.</p></br>

        <h3 style="text-align:center">Valorant DUALITY Animation: Mirror World and Mirror Agents</h3></br>
        <img src="dual.png" style="width:470px;height:264px" border="5" align="middle"></br>
        <p>   One day after the rise of Ascent, agents were called back to resolve another issue in the Bind map. A spike was planted and nobody wanted another Venice incident on their
            hands. Killjoy was defusing the spike, while Phoenix saw the enemy. Chasing him, Phoenix didn't expect to see an exact mirror replica of himself! This was the biggest
            Valorant lore reveal of all times. Mirror agents exist in another world fighting the best agents in our original world. The spike's purpose is to steal Radianite, meaning
            that the attacking side is the Mirror agents, while the defending site is the original agents. We know this through small details scattered across social media and 
            in-game: mirror agents have depleted their Radianite resources, and they are looking to steal it from our original world with the spike. That's how we know that the 
            Jett in the Ascend incident was her mirror counterpart! After the fight, we can see that Phoenix doesn't know what is going on, while Viper's already in the clear about 
            it. So still a lot of people are clueless about the mirror world. Although we kept it general about the main events, next up we'll take a look at some agents that have
            heavy Valorant lore implications.</p></br>

        <h4>KAY/O: Valorant's Story Peacekeeper</h4>
        <p>   Let's get this clear: KAY/O isn't from the original world, but an alternate world different from the mirror world we know of. In this alternate world, the agents got 
            their merry way. Overfilled with power, they started to massacre anyone who wasn't bestowed with superpowers and who disobeyed them. KAY/O was created to stop this. We 
            don't know by who, but it is speculated that it was Killjoy who made KAY/O. On top of that dystopia of killing everyone was Reyna. KAY/O got the strength and killed her, 
            freeing that world of the powerful reign the evil agents had. After this, KAY/O hopped in a teleporter to our world to make sure nothing like that ever happens. But he was 
            met with the evil forces of the mirror world. This is important because once the threat with mirror agents is resolved, we may face a threat story-wise among our agents!</p></br>
        <h4>Chamber: Valorant's Story Peacebreaker</h4>
        <p>   When the Chamber cinematic was released, everyone was confused. While every agent is fighting their mirror counterparts, Chamber is working alongside his mirror version! 
            But why is Chamber important to the Valorant story? Well, the VALORANT Protocol was searching for a way to reach that mirror world. While on this mission, Brimstone and 
            Viper got trapped. Chamber was the one who helped them out of that trap, whereas he joined the VALORANT Protocol. Although Chamber helped the VALORANT Protocol, even 
            establishing a way to reach the mirror world, he isn't as innocent as he seems. The Fracture map was a research facility called the Everett-Linde research facility. This 
            facility's purpose was to create a source with unlimited Radianite to help out the mirror world and the original world. Chamber and his mirror counterpart destroyed it.
            Why? We don't know, but this process killed many scientists and it killed a cause for the greater good and peace of the world.</p></br>
        <p>Every agent has their story, but this is the overall lore of Valorant. These are the main events and agents we should keep an eye on, as they prove time and time again to be 
            really important in the story. Some speculate that the next map may be located in the mirror world, but nothing's for sure. With the Blackmailer dropping in heavy story 
            plots as of lately, we can only wait to see what the Valorant lore will bring us next!</p></br>
